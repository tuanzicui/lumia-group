# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an associate professor at the John Hopcroft Center of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), and I am leading the Language Understanding and Machine Intelligence Algorithms (LUMIA) group. Before joining SJTU, I was a visiting scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Menlo Park, CA, working with Michael Auli. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Mila lab in the University of Montreal in 2019, where I was fortunately supervised by Yoshua Bengio. During my Ph.D., I've been interning at Google AI in the Language team in New York City, and at IBM Watson with Bowen Zhou and Mo Yu in Yorktown Height, NY. I also worked as a part-time student researcher at Microsoft Research with Alessandro Sordoni and Adam Trischler in Montreal. Prior to Mila, I received my B.Sc. (2012) and M.Sc. (2014) degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology. For more information, you can find my CV here.
